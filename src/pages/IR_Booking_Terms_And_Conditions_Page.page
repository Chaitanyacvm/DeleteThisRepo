      a) If the carriage of your shipment is solely or partly by air and involves an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of departure the Warsaw Convention (1929), or the Warsaw Convention as amended by the Hague Protocol (1955) and/or Montreal Protocol No. 4 (1975), or the Montreal Convention (1999), whichever is compulsorily applicable will apply.

In the case of delay where you can show to us you have suffered loss our liability is limited to refunding to you the charge you paid us for carriage in respect of that shipment or the part which was delayed.</p><p>
      c) If none of the above conventions apply and we have a liability to you for whatever reason including breach of contract, negligence, wilful act or default our liability to you for loss, damage, misdelivery or non-delivery of your shipment or the part affected is limited to the lower of the market value of the shipment at the time of carriage or the cost of repair the shipment or the part affected with in each case an upper limit that does not exceed £15 per kilo limited to a maximum of £15,000 per shipment. In the case of delay where you can show to us you have suffered loss our liability is limited to refunding to you the charge you paid us for carriage in respect of that shipment or the part which was delayed. </p>
    <p>12.2 Subject to condition 13 below, if we have a liability relating to other services for whatever reason, including without limitation breach of contract, negligence, wilful act or default, our liability to you is at all times limited to £15,000 per event or series of events with one and the same cause of damage or, in case of the loss of or damage to a shipment, to the lower of the market value of the shipment or the cost of repairing the shipment or the part affected with in every case an upper limit that does not exceed £50 per kilo with a maximum of £15,000 per event or series of connected events.</p><p>
      <strong>13. EXCLUSIONS</strong></p><p>
      13.1 We will not be liable for any loss of income, loss of profits, loss of markets, loss of reputation, loss of customers, loss of use, loss of an opportunity even if we had knowledge that such damages or loss might arise or for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages or loss howsoever arising including, without limitation breach of contract, negligence, wilful act or default. </p><p>
      13.2 We are not liable if your shipment or any part of it is lost, damaged, delayed or mis-delivered or not delivered or if we do not fulfil any obligations towards you at all as a result of:</p><p>
      a) circumstances beyond our control such as (but not limited to): </p>
    <ul>
      <li>acts of god including earthquakes, cyclones, storms, flooding, fire, disease, fog, snow or frost;</li>

      <li>criminal acts of third parties such as theft and arson.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>  b) your acts or omissions or those of third parties such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you being in breach of (or any other party claiming an interest in the shipment causing you to breach) your obligations under these terms and conditions and in particular those warranties set out in condition 11;</li>
      <li>an act or omission of any customs, airline, airport or government official.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>  c) The contents of the shipment consisting of any article that is a prohibited item even though we may have accepted the shipment by mistake.</p>
    <p>
      13.3 We are not a common carrier and do not accept from you any liabilities of a common carrier. </p><p>
      <strong>14 VALUABLE GOODS</strong></p><p>
      You should not send valuable goods such as precious stones, precious metals, jewellery, money, negotiable instruments, unprotected furniture, glass or china, objects of art, antiques and important documents that include passports, tenders, share and option certificates through our network delivery system because it involves the use of mechanical handling and automated sortation equipment together with multiple transhipments on and off vehicles which could result in loss and/or damage. If you nevertheless send, or cause us to send, such goods through our network delivery system it shall be at your own risk.</p><p>
      <strong>15.  INCREASED LIMITS OF LIABILITY FOR INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENTS</strong> </p><p>
      15.1  An increased limit of liability option ("ITLL") can be purchased for the carriage of international shipments for loss or damage to your shipment (non document shipment) subject to the conclusion of a specific agreement to that effect between you and us.</p><p>
      15.2  On payment by you to us of our current charge for the ITLL, we will increase our limit of liability for loss or damage to your shipment to £30 per kilogram for shipments of 10 kilograms and above and for loss or damage to shipments below 10 kilograms to £300 per shipment provided that at all times the maximum liability that we offer and accept is £15,000 per shipment. </p><p>
      15.3  ITLL does not apply where: </p><p>
      a) our liability is excluded as set out in these terms and conditions,</p><p>
      b) no specific agreement to that effect exists between you and TNT, and/or </p><p>
      c) you fail to pay us our charge for the increase in our limit of liability.</p><p>
      15.4  For the avoidance of doubt, ITLL does not cover losses of a consequential nature (see condition 13.1 above) or delays in carriage or where the loss has arisen as a result of your breach of your obligations under these terms and conditions. </p><p>
      15.5  ITLL is not available for other services or for precious stones, precious metals, laptop computers, plasma or LCD screens, jewellery, money, glass, china, objects of art, antiques, documents or any films, tapes, discs, memory cards or any such other data or image carrying goods. If you do send such goods we recommend that you arrange insurance. </p>
    <p><strong>16. ENHANCED LIABILITY</strong></p><p>
      16.1  You may, against payment of the indicated charge, make a declaration on the consignment note of the value of the shipment (non document shipment) exceeding the limits laid down in condition 11 up to a maximum of £15,000 per shipment ("Enhanced Liability"). Declaration must be made by completing the relevant box on the consignment note and paying the indicated charge. Compensation for proved loss or damage to your shipment may be claimed up to the total amount of the above declared value. Enhanced Liability is not available for precious stones, precious metals, laptop computers, plasma and LCD screens, jewellery, money, glass, china, objects of art, antiques, documents (other than the reconstitution cost as provided for in condition 16.2 below) or any films, tapes, discs, memory cards or any such other data or image carrying goods. If you do send such goods we recommend that you arrange insurance yourself.</p><p>
      16.2  You may opt for Enhanced Liability limited to the cost of reconstruction, reproducing, reissuing or re-printing cost (including the costs of the materials (e.g. paper) plus reasonable labour costs) of your document shipment by completing the relevant box on the consignment note and paying the indicated charge. Compensation for proved loss or damage to your document shipment may be claimed up to £350 per shipment. This Enhanced Liability option is only available for documents which are listed on our website www.tnt.co.uk or by contacting our Customer Services.</p><p>
      16.3  The above Enhanced Liability options (16.1 and 16.2) (i) do not provide compensation for losses of a consequential nature (see condition 13.1 above) or delays in carriage or where the loss has arisen as a result of your breach of your obligations under these terms and conditions of carriage, (ii) are not available for non-carriage services and (iii) are not available for a limited number of countries. For a list of these countries, and/or to obtain further details on the conditions of Enhanced Liability, please visit our website www.tnt.co.uk.or contact our Customer Services. </p><p>
      <strong>17. CLAIMS BROUGHT BY THIRD PARTIES</strong></p><p>
      You undertake to us that you shall not permit any other person who has an interest in the shipment to bring a claim or action against us even though we may have been negligent or in default and if a claim or action is made you will indemnify us against the consequences of the claim or action and the costs and expenses we incur in defending it.<br />
      <strong><br />
      18. CLAIMS PROCEDURE</strong></p><p>
      If you wish to claim for a lost, damaged or delayed shipment or for any other damages you must comply with any applicable convention and with the following procedure otherwise we reserve the right to reject your claim:</p><p>
      a) you must notify us about the loss, damage or delay within 7 days after delivery of the shipment or within 7 days of the date the shipment should have been delivered or if the claim relates to other services within 21 days from the date you ought reasonably to have become aware of the loss, damage or delay. If we send you a claim form you must return it within 21 days from the date of issue fully completed together with all relevant documentation in support of your claim. We are not obliged to act on any claim until our charges have been paid nor are you entitled to deduct the amount of your claim from our charges;</p><p>
      b) we will assume the shipment was delivered in good condition unless the receiver has noted any damage on our delivery record when he or she accepted the shipment. In order for us to consider a claim for damage, the contents of your shipment and the original packaging must be made available to us for inspection;</p><p>
      c) save as otherwise provided by any applicable convention and or law, your right to claim damages against us shall be extinguished unless an action is brought in a court of law within 1 year from the date of delivery of the shipment or from the date on which the shipment should have been delivered or from the date on which the carriage ended or if the claim relates to other services within 1 year from the date you ought reasonably to have become aware of the loss, damage or delay;</p><p>
      d)    in case of acceptance by us of part or all of your claim, you warrant to us that your insurers or any other third party having an interest in the shipment shall have waived rights, remedies or relief to which they might become entitled by subrogation or otherwise;</p>
    <p>e) the shipment shall not be deemed to be lost until at least 30 days have elapsed since the date you notified us of the non delivery. We may agree with you in writing to shorten this period.</p><p>
      <strong>19. RATES AND PAYMENT</strong></p><p>
      19.1 You agree to pay our charges for the carriage of the shipment between the locations specified on the consignment note/contract of carriage or for the performance by us of other services and any value added taxes thereon within 7 days from the date of our invoice for international shipments and by the 15th of the month after the month in which the invoice is dated in respect of UK domestic shipments.  You waive all your rights to challenge our invoices if you do not contest our invoice in writing within 7 days from the date of the invoice. Our charges are calculated in accordance with the rates applicable to your shipment as set out in our current rate card or in the relevant contract. We may check the weight and/or volume of and/or the number of items within your shipment and if we find that there is a discrepancy between your declared weight and/or volume and/or number of items you agree that the weight and/or volume and/or the number of items that we determine may be used for the purpose of our calculation. As a matter of course all import duties, value added taxes on goods and all other charges levied on the shipment in the destination country shall be payable to us by the receiver upon delivery of the shipment and if the receiver refuses to pay you agree to pay us these amounts in full within 7 days of us notifying you that the receiver has not paid. You agree that we may charge interest on all invoices not paid within 7 days from the invoice date at the rate of 6% above the European Central Bank base rate. You agree to pay our reasonable and proper cost of collection of invoices not paid within 7 days from the invoice date. </p><p>
      19.2 Our current rate card is available on request from any of our offices in the country from which the shipment is invoiced. We charge for either the actual weight of the shipment or the volumetric weight of the shipment whichever is the higher and the volumetric weight is calculated in accordance with the volumetric conversion equation set out in our rate card.<br />
       
      <br />
      19.3 The door to door delivery rates shown on our current rate card include provision for simple customs clearance formalities and we reserve the right to charge an extra administration fee where time-consuming excessive customs clearance work is needed to enable us to deliver your shipment to the receiver. Additional charges may therefore be applied in some countries for complex customs clearance activities and these include but are not limited to shipments that require:</p><p>
      (i) formal customs entries involving more than three different commodities.</p><p>
      (ii) customs bonds or the need to deliver goods under a customs bond.<br />
       
      <br />
      (iii) temporary import facilities</p><p>
      (iv) clearances involving a government department other than the customs authority</p><p>
      We may in some countries make advance payments of import duty, taxes, penalties or have to post bond on behalf of the importer and where this additional service is provided a local administration fee will be charged to the receiver and you will be liable for this charge if he or she does not pay us.</p><p>
